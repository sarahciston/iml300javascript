# Not So Vanilla üç¶ "Just" Javascript

## What Is Javascript?

> "The programming language of HTML and the Web. Interaction with the user, animation, etc, all done with JavaScript." (Q)

## What's a Javascript Library

> P5 is a Javascript **library**, which means it's an add-on set of Javascript that's been pre-written to make certain things easy. But there's a lot Javascript can already do.

> Pssst, we've been coding in Javascript _this whole time!_

> And there's a TON of other JS libraries for ANY specialized thing you might want to do, from make sleek websites, to run servers, to music, virtual reality, or machine learning. [Here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries)

> We say "vanilla"üç¶ Javascript when we mean not using any added libraries, but usually you're always using _some_... this demo will offer some code concepts that apply to web development as well as general times you're working with Javascript situations.

## Review: Setup

- **Files** are structured same as here whether they are saved locally, on the Glitch or P5 web editor, or served by your web host. 

- **Scripts** are loaded in the HTML for P5 or any any outside libraries, as well as your own script files.
  - 2 ways, each with benefits, either one use the `<script></script>` tag in your index file:
  - _cloud_: fewer steps, stays up to date
  - _local_: you save the file so you control it, works offline, doesn't randomly update on you

- **The DOM**
> "An HTML document is structured according to the Document Object Model, or ‚ÄúDOM‚Äù. [...] The DOM consists of every element on the page, laid out in a hierarchical way that reÔ¨Çects the way the HTML document is ordered." (Q)

- **Elements** use `<tags>` and have parent/child relationships
  - id vs class: (single vs groups)
  - styles: (inline vs css file)

- **Comments** are written as single and multiline.   - Keyboard shortcut to toggle: `Command+Slash` 
  - Comments are an _essential_ part of coding, debugging, & documenting--for you and others!
  - `//` single line
  - `/* */` multi line

## Review: P5.js DOM 
> Besides adding functions to JS, the P5.js library "wraps" up some Javascript to simplify the syntax. 

> P5's [DOM functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM):
  - `selectElement()`
  - `createElement('tag', [content inside])`
  - `createDiv([html/content])`
  - [Things to do on a selected or created element](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element)(`el`):
    - `el.style('color', 'black')`, `el.style('font-size', '18px')`
    - `el.position(0,0)` (absolute position)
    - `el.attribute('align', 'center')`
    - `el.hide()`, `el.show()`
    - `el.size()`
    - `el.html(<tag></tag)>, true)` note: the additon of true appends instead of replacing (if no argument, returns existing)
    - `el.parent()`, `el.child()` attaches new thing to existing thing
    - [Events](https://youtu.be/HsDVz2_Qgow): `createButton()`, `el.mouseClicked()`, `el.mouseOver()`, `el.mouseOut()`, `changed()`, `createInput()`
    - Highly recommend the [callbacks on multiple elements video](https://youtu.be/KeZBpeH59Q4)

>These are all "wrappers" of the same code you learned to write in plain JS. Behind the scenes, it's calling that plain JS to do this work.

## Essential Javascript for Web

- **Select** by id, class, element/tag, parent, child

  - `document.getElementById('id')` `document.getElementByClassName('class')` `document.querySelector('#id')` `document.querySelectorAll('.class')`
  - Note the different syntax options. [Document](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp) for more choices.
  - set it to a variable name to 'save' it for reuse:
    `let line = document.querySelector('#line') //selects the element with the id line`

- **Create** makes new elements and [**Append**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp) places the items we made where we want them

  ```javascript
  let button = document.createElement("BUTTON"); // creates a button but hasn't put it anywhere yet
  button.innerHTML = "click me"; // puts text in the button
  line.appendChild(button); // adds a button inside every paragraph
  ```

- **Add/remove class is *confusing, don't worry*** because they're each doing slightly different things

  - `el.className = 'class'` set equal to [className](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_classname.asp) makes it that class only, erases any others
  - OR: `el.classList.toggle('class')` note [toggle](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp) on/off choice can avoid a check before if/then but might intro errors
  - OR: [add/remove from classList](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_add_class.asp) `el.classList.add('class')` and `el.classList.remove('class')` note the name is in quotes but doesn't need dot before it because class is in the attribute, ...maintains a list of classes

- [**Modify Styles**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp)

  - `el.style.color = 'blue'`
  - `el.style.borderBottom = '1px dotted black'`

- [**Events**](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp):
  - think about how these events combine using 1) thing you touch and 2) thing you want to affect
  - click, scroll, hover, mouseEnter/Leave, slideToggle etc. onclick vs item.click()
  - Hide/show/fade/delay/toggle all done with **callbacks**:
    `document.addEventListener('eventname', functionName)` ``
  - [Transformations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp)
  
>Note where elements appear, in the canvas vs in the rest of the DOM/page depending on how you're writing them. As you're blending the P5 library with other Javascript this can get confusing. P5 has ways to do both, but they're different. So does plain JS. They serve different purposes:
  - e.g. Choose `createImage()` (P5) or `document.createElement('IMG')` and then `appendChild` (plainJS) anywhere in the DOM vs choose `image()` to put it inside a canvas element.  
  - Choose `setup()` or `draw()` depending on if you want it to happen once or repeatedly, only works in P5.

## Review: Logics of Code** 

> You already know (because you know JS) or may see around town:

1. **[Callbacks](https://youtu.be/NcCEzzd9BGE) and Code Patterns**
  - MAKE & NAME : create a thing & assign it to a variable so you can keep referring to it
  - SCHEDULE & ACT: use functions to say what you want to do with it when
    
    ```
    var thing = new Thingy() //MAKE & NAME
    thing.doStuff('click', actFunction) //SCHED
    
    //ACT
    function actFunction(){
      console.log("outcome")
    }
    ```
  >Thingy() initializes an object of the class Thingy, which already has a method (function) .doStuff(), we're saying to run it when 'click' happens and to run actFunction()
    
2. **Loops & Conditionals** 
  - `if`/`then` and `if`/`else`
  - `for` loops `for (let i=0; i<list.length;i++){}` and `for (let l in list){}`
  - `try`/`catch` and the dreaded `while`

3. **Data Types** Javascript is wild & doesn't label its types like other languages do
  - individual: 
    - strings ("text")
    - numbers (integers, floats, binary, etc.)
    - boolean (True, False)
  - groups: 
    - *arrays* aka lists 
    - *objects* aka dictionaries or key-value paired lists etc. 
    - *sets* (stricter lists of *unique* items)
    - functions
  - imported data that can be converted to the above: JSON, CSV, TXT, etc.

4. Additional Considerations & Weirdnesses
  - Helps to write pseudocode to start
  - Comments are a great debug strategy (Note where your `console.log()` comments appear in glitch, frontend vs backend concepts)
  - Include error handling.
  - `let` works the same as `var` and `const`, they all initialize variables. Let is the preferred going forward. JS used to distinguish between variable and constant. 
  - arrow functions:
 if you see them, don't let them confuse you: 
`let myFunction = () => console.log("sarah")` is same as ```
  function myFunction(){
    console.log("sarah")
  }
  - Glitch has a back-end/server-side Log/Console besides the front-end console you're used to seeing in the browser's dev tools. Check it out!

## BONUS: Libraries & Frameworks & Expansion Oh My!

> Ways people have solved problems, tried to make life easier and made it more complicated, aka words you might see around town & more to think about later

  ### Helpers
  
  - [p5]
  - [JQuery]
  - What are some others you've heard of? Do you know what they do?

  ### Design for web layout, look, & feel

  - [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating language, pre-built buttons and CSS for your sites, lots of others like it, such as...
  - Bootstrap, Semantic.io, Material.io (React)
  - [React] a whole superset of JS built by Facebook to make complex sites with many components. Other Frameworks like it are Vue and Angular. You only need to learn one of these, if any. 

  ### Design tools for specific tasks

  - [Tiny Tools Directory](https://tinytools.directory/) by Everest Pipkin
  - [ScrollMagic](https://scrollmagic.io/) scroll effects
  - [Paper.js] curves & swerves
  - [Three.js] 3D stuff

  ### Servers & Offline

  - [Node.js] a superset of Javascript that lets you do servers and use JS without a browser, just in your local machine. A great place to start with Node is the Glitch template! Use Node for websites where you want a database or need to send info back and forth to a server.
  - [Express.js] makes it easy to make a server, part of the Node template in Glitch

  ### Machine Learning

  - [ML5](https://ml5js.org), part of the p5/Processing family, is a simpler version of (aka built on/wrapper of Tensorflow)
  - [Tensorflow.js] 
  - Lots of little ML tools out there, another lesson maybe for code collective?

## Examples made with (almost) "just" javascript

- [Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com/) only uses a bit of JQuery but wouldn't need it. Also another type of site your project could be, gathering resources/examples for others.

- []()

## Your Project

### ‚Üê index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website. This can start out barebones because you can add so much with Javascript. Good rule of thumb is to put in HTML anything that will stay static. Javascript is for interactivity!

### ‚Üê style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content. Remember you can change these with Javascript too.

### ‚Üê script.js

Literally where the action happens. Add interactivity with JavaScript. Can also be inside your HTML file if you only have a little bit of script. Woo!

### ‚Üê assets

A folder. Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project. Often for bigger projects you'll create separate folders for your styles and javascript files too.

### ‚Üê README.md

That's this file. It doesn't show up to your end-user/reader. In this case I'm using it for a tutorial. You might use it for documentation about how you made your site or how others could implement your tool.
